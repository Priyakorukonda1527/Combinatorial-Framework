 Combinatorial Optimization Framework

## Project Description
The **Combinatorial Optimization Framework** is a Python-based platform designed to solve a wide range of combinatorial optimization problems, such as **Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), Knapsack Problem, and Graph Matching**, using multiple algorithmic strategies.  

This framework allows users to **compare the performance of different algorithms**, experiment with real-world datasets, and extend the platform to solve new problems efficiently.

## Key Features
- **Multiple Solving Strategies**:
  - **Greedy Heuristics**: Fast, approximate solutions using local optimization.
  - **Divide & Conquer**: Breaks large problems into smaller sub-problems and combines results.
  - **Dynamic Programming (DP)**: Optimizes repeated computations using memoization.
  - **Backtracking Search**: Explores all possible solutions while pruning invalid paths.
  - **Branch & Bound**: Reduces search space using bounds to improve efficiency.
  
- **Performance Comparison**:
  - Evaluate accuracy and efficiency of different algorithms on the same dataset.
  
- **Extensible Design**:
  - Easily add new combinatorial problems or optimization algorithms.
  - Modular and reusable code structure for maintainability.

- **Real-World Applications**:
  - Can be used in logistics, scheduling, resource allocation, network optimization, and more.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python 3.x  
- **Libraries**: `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`  
- **Version Control**: Git & GitHub
